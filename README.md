# The C Programming Language Answers

It's not an app, it's a collection of small programs that answers to exercises of the books "The C programming language" (by B.R.KERNIGHAN && D.M.RITCHIE)

Welcome to the repository for "tcpl_exercise" a.k.a "The C programming language Answers" â€” a comprehensive answers to exercises from the book The C programming language (B.R.KERNIGHAN && D.M.RITCHIE) 
This project aims to serve as complete annoted answers and reflexions for all developper that want to dive into C. I made these exercises with help too, don't be affraid to use it, i want to share
2 ressources that have been really helpful during this (#link to ressources), sometimes when you're stuck you're happy to understand or even compare your solution with other make you understand deeper the solution
and maybe correct some mistakes.
